# 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulations & Random Walks: Exploring the Uniform Distribution** 🎲  

**What happens when randomness is truly fair?** In this repository, we dive into the power of the **uniform distribution**—where every outcome is equally likely. Whether estimating π, modeling movement, or simulating stochastic processes, the uniform distribution is at the heart of Monte Carlo methods.  

## 🚀 **What’s Inside?**  

This repo contains hands-on Python examples showcasing **uniformly distributed randomness** in action:  

### 1️⃣ **Monte Carlo Estimation of π**  
📌 We generate random points uniformly within a square and use them to estimate the value of π. By calculating the ratio of points that land inside a unit circle, we uncover a fascinating connection between randomness and geometry.  

### 2️⃣ **Random Walk Simulation**  
📌 A particle takes steps in one of four equally likely directions (up, down, left, or right). This simple model mimics real-world diffusion and serves as a foundation for more complex stochastic processes.  

### 3️⃣ **Biased Random Walk with Force**  
📌 What if a force influences movement while still maintaining uniform randomness? This variation introduces a directional bias while preserving the core idea of uniform probability at each step.  

## 🎯 **Why the Uniform Distribution?**  

The **uniform distribution** is the starting point of many simulations, providing a foundation for randomness that’s:  
✅ **Fair** – Every possible outcome has an equal chance of occurring.  
✅ **Simple Yet Powerful** – Used in everything from game design to physics simulations.  
✅ **Building Block of Probability** – Many complex distributions originate from uniform randomness.
